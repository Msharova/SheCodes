        <span class="breed">The Devon Rex</span> is a tall-eared, short-haired
        breed of cat that emerged in England during the late 1950s. They are
        known for their slender bodies, wavy coat, and large ears. This breed of
        cat is capable of learning difficult tricks but can be hard to motivate.
        The Devon Rex is a breed of cat with a curly, very soft short coat
        similar to that of the Cornish Rex. They are often thought of as one of
        the most hypoallergenic cats available because of their type of coat.
        However, they are technically not hypoallergenic. The first Devon was
        discovered by Beryl Cox in Buckfastleigh, Devon, UK, in 1959. The breed
        was initially thought to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test
        mating proved otherwise.
